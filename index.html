    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); //logs 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); //logs 200 100

    let name = 'Wes';
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2); // Wes Wes
    name = 'wesley';
    console.log(name, name2);// wesley Wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; //a reference
    console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    //if you update an array it will always reference back

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice(); //this will give us a copy of the actual array

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players); //this will do the same thing

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawwww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'cool';
    console.log(team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99; //this will change the original object too!!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 }); //this one doesnt change the number or age
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'webos.developer'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // dev.name = 'Wesley' //will only change the name in the dev object (not the wes object)

    // dev.social.twitter = '@coolman' //this will also change the social handle in the wes object since assign just goes one level deep

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //this turns the object to a string and then back into an object and is reffered to as the poor mans deep clone
    dev2.social.twitter = '@coolman' //now it will only change the social var in dev2
